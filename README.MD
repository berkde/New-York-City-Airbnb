# üóΩNYC Airbnb Host Popularity Prediction App

This project predicts **Airbnb host popularity** using a stacked machine learning model that combines **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** with a **Ridge Regression** meta-learner. The notebook constructs a custom popularity score using review volume, listing price, and recent activity, making this a valuable tool for host performance analytics.

## Features

* Custom popularity score based on:

  * Total number of reviews (log-scaled)
  * Listing price
  * Recency of last review
* Ensemble model: XGBoost + Random Forest + Ridge
* Log-transformed regression target
* Clean, normalized feature space
* Feature importance visualization
* Ready for extension to Streamlit or web app
